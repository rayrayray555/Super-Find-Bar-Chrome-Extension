## Full Description (Plain Text Format for Chrome Web Store)

🎯 Why Super Find Bar?

Still using Chrome's basic Ctrl+F? That "basic edition" that can only search one word, doesn't support regex, and can't find hidden content? Time to upgrade! Super Find Bar supercharges your web search capabilities 🚀

Perfect for academic research, code review, AI conversations, and everyday browsing. Search multiple terms simultaneously with color-coded highlights, use fuzzy search to handle typos, leverage regex for advanced patterns, and find hidden content in menus and tabs. The smart refresh system automatically detects dynamic content (like ChatGPT and Gemini), while the radar button with ripple animation instantly locates targets. X/Y axis markers visualize all search positions at a glance.

Key features include multi-term color highlighting (7 customizable colors), fuzzy search with adjustable tolerance, coordinate axis visualization, radar quick locate, smart refresh for dynamic content, intelligent hidden content search, auto performance optimization, flexible layout system (floating/top/bottom bar with 6 positions), dark theme customization, and multi-language support with cross-device sync.

Privacy first: zero data collection, local storage only, optional Chrome sync, 100% open source. Quick start: Press Ctrl+Shift+F (Mac: Cmd+Shift+F), enter keywords, navigate with ◀ ▶ or F3/Shift+F3, customize via ⚙️ settings.

Note: PDFs require Chrome's built-in search. Google Docs/Sheets/Slides have security restrictions. Chrome system pages cannot be used.

Make web search more powerful, start with Super Find Bar! 🚀
